# POPLAssignmentSwift
<h4>The objective of this assignment is to make a rudimentary parser and test type Equivalence with the help of a defined set of rules for the Programming Language <b>Swift</b></h4>
<p> Currently, the program supports the following functionality </p>
<ul>
  <li> Variables </li>
  <li> Functions </li>
  <li> Structures </li>
  <li> Arrays </li>
</ul>
<h3> Note:</h3>
<p> We make use of structural equivalence only for the atomic data types.</p>
